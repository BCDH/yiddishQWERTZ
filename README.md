# Yiddish QWERTZ Keyboard for the Mac

This is a phonetic Yiddish keyboard layout for the Macs with a QWERTZ physical keyboard. It is based on the [Yiddish Klal](https://www.isaacbleaman.com/resources/yiddish_typing/), created by Isaac L. Bleaman.

QWERTY is the standard keyboard layout in English-speaking and many other countries, whereas QWERTZ prevails in German-speaking and some other European countries.

Our version of the Yiddish keyboard layout makes it easier to type Yiddish for anybody who is used to German keyboards. Not only is Z next to T and Y next to X, but punctuation marks and various symbols are also where you'd expect them to be.

Other than that, the Yiddish layout follows the principles of the above-mentioned Yiddish Klal, i.e.:

- Typing `a` will yield a _pasekh alef_, אַ
- `o` will yield a _komets alef_, אָ
- `e` will yield an _ayen_, ע
- `v` will yield _tsvey vovn_, װ (which Unicode treats a single character)
- `p` will yield a _pey_, פּ
- `f` will yield a _fey_, פֿ
- …, etc.

To type the final letters, hold

- `F` will yield a _langer fey_, ף
- `M` will yield a _shlos mem_, ם
…, etc.

Doublets (when YIVO transliteration corresponds to multiple Yiddish characters):

- `t` will yield a _tes_, ט
- `T` will yield a _tof_, תּ
- `s` will yield a _samekh_, ס
- `S` will yield a _sof_, ת
- `W` will yield a _sin_, שׂ (`w` will yield a _shin_, ש)
- `V` will yield a _veys_, בֿ (`v` will yield _tsvey vovn_, װ, as mentioned above)
- `k` or `q` will yield a _kuf_, ק
- `K` or `Q` will yield a _kof_, כּ

Other letters will be less intuitive for those familiar with the YIVO system of transliteration, e.g., because it sometimes uses a combination of several Latin letters for a single Yiddish letter (e.g., צ is [ts]). These letters will need to be memorized:

- `A` will yield a _shtumer alef_, א
- `x` will yield a _khof_, כ (and `X` a _langer khof_, ך)
- `H` will yield a _khes_, ח (`h` is just a _hey_, ה, as expected)
- `c` will yield a _tsadek_, צ (and `C` a _langer tsadek_, ץ)
- `w` will yield a _shin_, ש (and `W` a sin, שׂ)
- `j` or `E` will yield _tsvey yudn_, ײ (a single Unicode character)
- `y` will yield _pasekh tsvey yudn_, ײַ (two Unicode characters)
- `O` or `Y` will yield _vov yud_, ױ (a single Unicode character)

Letter combinations:

- For זש type either `z` `w` or, as a shortcut, type `Z`
- For דזש type either `d` `z` `w` or, as a shortcut, type `G` or `J` or `D`
- For טש type either `t` `w` or, as a shortcut, type `R` (mnemonic: between the `t` and `w` on the keyboard)
